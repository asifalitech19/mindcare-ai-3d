## 📌 Project Overview
**MindCare AI** is not just a chatbot; it's an AI with a "Soul". Moving beyond traditional rule-based bots, this project leverages **Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing)** to understand the *sentiment* behind human words.

Built using **Bidirectional LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks, the model can detect complex emotions like *Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, Love, and Surprise* with high accuracy (>80%). The interface is designed to be **Emotionally Responsive**—changing its background colors, 3D animations, and reaction emojis instantly to match the user's state of mind.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **🧠 Deep Learning Brain:** Trained on thousands of emotional text samples using a custom **Bidirectional LSTM** architecture for context-aware understanding.
* **🎨 Dynamic UI Adaptation:** The application physically reacts to emotions:
    * **Joy:** Glowing Yellow/Gold theme 🌟
    * **Sadness:** Calming Blue rain theme 💧
    * **Anger:** Alert Red theme 🛑
* **🔮 3D Immersive Experience:** Features floating glass-morphism cards and interactive **Lottie Animations** (Scanning Brain) to create a futuristic user experience.
* **⚡ Real-Time Inference:** Instant emotion classification using a lightweight, optimized TensorFlow model.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core AI:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras (Sequential Model).
* **NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, Padding, Word Embeddings (128-dim).
* **Frontend:** Streamlit, Custom CSS, Lottie Files.
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud (CodeCarbon integrated for sustainability tracking).

## 💡 How It Works
1.  **Input:** User types a sentence (e.g., "I finally got my dream job!").
2.  **Processing:** The text is tokenized and converted into numerical sequences.
3.  **Prediction:** The LSTM model analyzes the sequence (reading both left-to-right and right-to-left).
4.  **Reaction:** The UI updates instantly—displaying a **"Star Eyes" (🤩)** emoji and shifting the theme to **Purple/Gold**.
